module FprimeGds {

    @ Framer stage that strips the cFS telemetry secondary header (big-endian
    @ 4-byte seconds, 2-byte subseconds) from complete telemetry space packets,
    @ rebuilding the CCSDS primary header (length field and secondary header
    @ flag). The inverse of FPrimeCfs.CfsTlmFramer, for ground-facing bridges
    @ (e.g. a GDS bridge) whose downstream consumers expect bare F Prime
    @ packets inside the space packets. The strip is performed in place: the
    @ rebuilt primary header is written over the trailing bytes of the
    @ secondary header and the buffer's data pointer is advanced, so no
    @ allocation or copy is made. Command packets and packets without the
    @ secondary header flag are forwarded unchanged.
